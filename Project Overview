This project focuses on cleaning and analysing a real-world medical dataset that contains missing values, inconsistent formats, and duplicate records. 
The dataset was first imported into MySQL and then processed using Python to improve data quality and extract meaningful insights.
Using Pandas and NumPy, the data was cleaned and prepared for analysis. 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand trends and patterns. Visualisations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to clearly present the findings.

This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualisation using industry-relevant tools.
